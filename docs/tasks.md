# Lightweight Kanban

## How to use

1) Write new tasks as S.M.A.R.T goals + changes/artifacts.
2) Classify them either into [Next](#next) (highest priority) or [Backlog](#backlog) (unordered, lower priority).
3) Move tasks to [In Progress](#in-progress) when I start working on them.
4) Move tasks to [Done](#done) when I finish them.
5) When [Next](#next) is empty, move some tasks from [Backlog](#backlog) to [Next](#next).

Other rules:

- In progress: 1-2 tasks max, avoid multistasking.
- Next: 2-3 tasks max, keep it focused.
- Backlog and Done: unlimited.
- Task duration: break down big tasks into smaller ones, 1-2 days max each.
- History: create PRs and separate branches for non-trivial tasks, self-review them, add link here to PR, and merge directly to main.
- Main: working code. No development branch to keep it simple.
